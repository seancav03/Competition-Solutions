# Solutions from the 2020 HPE CodeWars Competition
All solutions created solely by Sean Cavalieri

# Overview
I captained a three person team for this multiday virtual competition. The competition was virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the extended length of this competition, we were able to solve all 30 problems successfully. The solutions for the problems I solved alone are provided here. I separated them into three folders: Low, Mid, and High Level. This pertains to the problem number which effectively coorelates to the difficulty of the problem. I would like to highlight problem 30 in the High Level Problems set. More information about that solution is provided in its respective folder.

# Problem Set
The entire problem set for this competition is contained in the file "Full Problem Set.pdf". The individual problem statements are also provided in the folder for each solution for convenience.

# Data Sets
The Student Dataset was provided to the students during the competition for testing purposes. The Judge Dataset was not accessable during the competition and was used to judge submissions. Submissions were only judges after the conclusion of the competition. See the zip files for the datasets in the Datasets folder.


# How to Run
### File and Input
All solutions are provided as `.java` files. All problem input is read from a local file named `input.txt`. You can get test data from the data sets for this purpose.
### Run on a Mac:
1. To compile the program, run `javac fileName.java`. This will generate a `fileName.class` file
2. To run the program, put the `input.txt` file in the directory with your `.class` file. Run the script with `java className` where className is the name of the class containing the main method of the problem. For these scripts, it will be called probXX where XX is the problem number, and this will match the file name.
3. Watch and Wonder! Explore my code to see how I solved the problem. Remember that these were solved under time pressure so comments, good variable names, and other good practices are intentionally excluded in alignment with the instruction of my team's coach, Brain Sea.
