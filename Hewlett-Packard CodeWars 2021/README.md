# Solutions from the 2021 HPE CodeWars Competition
All solutions created solely by Sean Cavalieri

# Overview
I captained a three person team for this virtual 3 hour competition. The competition was virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the standard competition format was maintained. Over the three hours, my team solved roughly half of the problems. This achieved a score that earned us second place in the Advanced division of our location. The solutions for the problems I solved alone are provided here. The higher level (more difficult) problems I solved are in their own folders here, and the lower level (easier) problems are in the folder titled "Low Level Problems". I would like to highlight problem 31. More information about this problem is provided in its respective folder.

# Problem Set
The entire problem set for this competition is contained in the file "Full Problem Set.pdf". The individual problem statements are also provided in the folder for each solution for convenience.

# Data Sets
The Student Dataset was provided to the students during the competition for testing purposes. The Judge Dataset was not accessable during the competition and was used to judge submissions. Solutions could be submitted during the competition to allow for revisions, though no information pertaining to the nature of the error was returned. See the zip files for the datasets in the Datasets folder.

# How to Run
### File and Input
All solutions are provided as `.java` files. All problem input is received through stdin. 
### Run on a Mac:
1. To compile the program, run `javac fileName.java`. This will generate a `fileName.class` file
2. To run the program, put your desired input text in a file. Run the script with `java className < inputTextFile.txt` where className is the name of the class containing the main method of the problem. For these scripts, it will be called probXX where XX is the problem number, and this will match the file name. `inputTextFile.txt` is the path to the file containing the desired input text.
3. Watch and Wonder! Explore my code to see how I solved the problem. Remember that these were solved under time pressure so comments, good variable names, and other good practices are intentionally excluded in alignment with the instruction of my team's coach, Brain Sea.
