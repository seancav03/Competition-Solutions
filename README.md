### Hewlett-Packard CodeWars 2020:
Result: Tied for first place internationally as captain of my three member team
Description: The 2020 annual HPE CodeWars competition. This competition was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of this, the competition had a time limit of multiple days. This allowed our team to solve every problem successful and tie with one other Texan team for first place.
### Hewlett-Packard CodeWars 2021:
Result: Second Place in Roseville Advanced Division as captain of my three member team
Description: The 2021 annual HPE CodeWars competition. This competition was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but was run as it normally would have been in person. The competition was three hours long, and we solved as many problems for as many points as possible in this time period.
